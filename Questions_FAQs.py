# How do I get Implied volatility data while importing option chain data?


# Ishan Shahâ€¢Last Year
# Thanks, Pradhyumn for your question. IV is a derived data. You can use the black Scholes model to get the IV. 
# For example, you can use python mibian library, pass the option price, strike price, underlying price, days to expiry, 
# type of option (call/put) to get the implied volatility.
